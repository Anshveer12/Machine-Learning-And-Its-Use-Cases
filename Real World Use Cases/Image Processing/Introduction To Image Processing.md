# Introduction to Image Processing

Image processing is a domain in machine learning that focuses on **analyzing, manipulating, and understanding images** to extract meaningful information or perform specific tasks. It combines principles of **computer vision and machine learning** to process visual data efficiently.

## Applications of Image Processing

### Object Detection and Recognition
- Identifying objects in an image and recognizing what they are.  
- **Examples:** Detecting faces in a photo, identifying vehicles, or recognizing handwriting.  
- **Popular Algorithms:** YOLO (You Only Look Once), Faster R-CNN, SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector).

### Image Classification
- Assigning a **label or category** to an image based on its content.  
- **Examples:** Classifying images of cats and dogs, diagnosing medical images.  
- **Common Techniques:** CNNs, Transfer Learning (ResNet, VGG).

### Image Segmentation
- Dividing an image into **regions or segments** to focus on specific areas of interest.  
- **Examples:** Tumor segmentation in medical scans, separating objects in an image.  
- **Techniques:** Semantic Segmentation (U-Net), Instance Segmentation (Mask R-CNN).

### Face Recognition
- Identifying or verifying a personâ€™s identity from an image or video.  
- **Examples:** Unlocking phones, security systems.  
- **Techniques:** DeepFace, FaceNet, Eigenfaces.

### Image Enhancement
- Improving the **quality of an image** by reducing noise, sharpening, or adjusting brightness/contrast.  
- **Examples:** Enhancing satellite images, improving visibility in low-light conditions.  
- **Techniques:** Histogram Equalization, GANs.
